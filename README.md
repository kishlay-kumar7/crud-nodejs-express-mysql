# CRUD Operations with MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and MySQL

This project demonstrates how to build a simple backend API using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **MySQL** to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to simplify routing and middleware handling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing structured data and handling SQL queries.

## Features:

- **MongoDB CRUD operations**: Implemented using MongoDB to store and manage unstructured data in collections.
- **MySQL CRUD operations**: Implemented using MySQL for structured data storage and SQL queries.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints to interact with the database through HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Error Handling**: Includes proper error handling for each operation.
